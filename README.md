# Australian-Wildfires-2019-Visualization
A data visualization project illustrating the spread and intensity of the 2019 Australian wildfires using only base R functions

Overview

This repository contains a graphical report and supporting materials for visualizing the Australian wildfires that occurred between December 2019 and January 2020. The aim of this project was to create visualizations in R using only base R functions without relying on external libraries like ggplot2. This showcases the ability to generate complex visualizations with core R functionality, highlighting fundamental coding and visualization skills. Grade: A

Data Source

The dataset was obtained from NASAâ€™s FIRMS platform, covering the time period from December 5, 2019, to January 5, 2020. It includes geolocated data on fire brightness, scan, and track attributes, providing insight into the distribution and intensity of the fires across Australia.

Visualizations

	1.	Main Map: A map of Australia visualizing the total area affected by the wildfires, with color gradients indicating confidence levels in fire detection.
	2.	Progression Map Sequence: A series of maps showing the cumulative spread of fires over time, providing a time-lapse of fire expansion.
	3.	Heatmap of Daytime and Nighttime Fires: A heatmap illustrating the total brightness of fires, comparing daytime and nighttime activity.
	4.	Line Chart of Fire Area Over Time: A line chart displaying the total affected area over time, calculated using the scan and track attributes from the FIRMS dataset.

Methodology

The visualization approach was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, avoiding the use of external libraries to emphasize basic R capabilities. This aligns with the goal of producing a visual report that balances data accuracy and accessibility for a general audience.
