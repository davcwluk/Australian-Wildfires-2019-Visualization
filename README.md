### Overview
This data visualization project was completed for the IM942 Visualization Foundations course (MSc Data Analytics, University of Warwick) and received an A grade. It visualizes the spread and intensity of the 2019 Australian wildfires using base R functions, focusing on graphical representation without external libraries.

### Data Source
The dataset was obtained from NASAâ€™s FIRMS platform, covering the time period from December 5, 2019, to January 5, 2020. It includes geolocated data on fire brightness, scan, and track attributes, providing insight into the distribution and intensity of the fires across Australia.

### Visualizations
1. Main Map: A map of Australia visualizing the total area affected by the wildfires, with color gradients indicating confidence levels in fire detection.
2. Progression Map Sequence: A series of maps showing the cumulative spread of fires over time, providing a time-lapse of fire expansion.
3. Heatmap of Daytime and Nighttime Fires: A heatmap illustrating the total brightness of fires, comparing daytime and nighttime activity.
4. Line Chart of Fire Area Over Time: A line chart displaying the total affected area over time, calculated using the scan and track attributes from the FIRMS dataset.

### Methodology
The visualization approach was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, avoiding the use of external libraries to emphasize basic R capabilities. This aligns with the goal of producing a visual report that balances data accuracy and accessibility for a general audience.
